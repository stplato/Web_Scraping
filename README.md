**1. ATP 100 Rankings Web Scraping:**
   - This project involves scraping the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) website to retrieve the ATP 100 rankings for each week.
   - The script collects data on player rankings, countries, player names, and points.
   - Data is stored in a pandas DataFrame and exported to a CSV file for further analysis.
